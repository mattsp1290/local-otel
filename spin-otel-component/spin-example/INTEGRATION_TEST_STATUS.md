# Integration Test Status Report

## Date: 2025-06-02

### Test Execution Summary

#### Milestone 1: Component Loading ❌
**Status**: Blocked - Build issues encountered

**Findings**:
1. Spin CLI is not installed on the test system
2. Go SDK build issues when targeting WASM:
   - `undefined: get`, `undefined: post`, `undefined: send` errors
   - Occurs with both v2.0.0 and v2.2.0 of the Spin Go SDK
3. Component dependency configuration in `spin.toml` has been set up correctly

#### Configuration Updates Applied ✅

1. **spin.toml** - Added component dependency:
```toml
[component.http-handler.dependencies]
"local:otel/telemetry" = { path = "../otel-component.wasm" }
```

2. **Allowed outbound hosts** for OTLP export:
```toml
allowed_outbound_hosts = ["http://localhost:4318", "http://host.docker.internal:4318"]
```

### Blockers Discovered

1. **Primary Blocker**: Spin Go SDK incompatibility with WASM build
   - The SDK seems to have missing implementations for WASM target
   - This prevents us from building the test application

2. **Secondary Blocker**: Unclear component import mechanism
   - The documentation for importing WIT-based components in Spin apps is unclear
   - Need to research the proper way to use component dependencies in Spin

### Attempted Solutions

1. ✅ Updated go.mod and project structure
2. ✅ Configured spin.toml with component dependencies
3. ❌ Tried multiple versions of Spin Go SDK
4. ❌ Attempted to import component bindings directly

### Next Steps

1. **Install Spin CLI**:
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://developer.fermyon.com/downloads/install.sh | bash
   ```

2. **Research Alternative Approaches**:
   - Consider using Rust for the Spin example app (better WASM support)
   - Investigate if there's a different way to test the component
   - Look into Spin's component model documentation

3. **Fallback Testing Strategy**:
   - Test the component directly using a WASM runtime
   - Create unit tests for the component implementation
   - Use the debug exporter to verify functionality

### Partial Success

Despite the integration blockers, we have:
- ✅ Successfully built the WASM component (3MB)
- ✅ Generated WIT bindings
- ✅ Implemented MVP functionality with debug exporter
- ✅ Configured the test application structure

### Recommendations

1. **Immediate**: Focus on unit testing the component functionality
2. **Short-term**: Research Spin's component model more thoroughly
3. **Medium-term**: Consider creating a Rust-based test application
4. **Long-term**: Contribute documentation/examples back to Spin community

### Test Scenarios (To Be Executed)

Once build issues are resolved:
- [ ] Basic HTTP request logging
- [ ] Multiple concurrent requests
- [ ] Provider lifecycle management
- [ ] Error handling scenarios
- [ ] Performance measurements

### Conclusion

While we've made progress on the component implementation and test setup, the integration testing is blocked by tooling issues. The component itself appears to be correctly implemented, but we need to resolve the Spin SDK compatibility issues before we can proceed with full integration testing.
